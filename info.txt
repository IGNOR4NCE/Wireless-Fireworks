Project			Function
FireworksSimulator	Play the csv in a simulated environment. Hardcoded for a specific show.
FireworksGuiAndroid	Qt Android based controller
FireworksGui		Qt computer based controller (tested under Ubuntu 14)

FireModule		Code for slats
FireControlSlave	Send commands from computer or Android to slats.
                        To build Android version #define USE_BLUETOOTH
                        To build computer version undefine USE_BLUETOOTH
FireModuleTest		Run radio, display, and relay tests on a slat


FireControl		This was meant to be an Arduino based controller - never completed
FireComputer		Command line script player - used in original testing but never completed

Example show script is in

Note: Most of the fields are hardcoded because I was in a rush to get this running for the Fourth of July holiday!
There is minimal error checking.

While this was a great project I've decided to buy a commercial system so there will likely not be any updates to this project.
This was a fun learning experience - until the deadline began to loom closer and closer then it became a mad dash to the finish line!
You'll notice the lack of comments - this is unfortunate, but as a side project aspects of a civilized project had to suffer.

GOOD LUCK and be SAFE!
